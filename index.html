                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: What is the goal of the recession risk nowcast?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: Timely knowledge of whether the economy is experiencing a broad-based decline in economic activity is a key input to a variety of decision-making processes. <a href="https://doi.org/10.4337/9781035310050.00011" target="_blank">Furno and Giannone (2024)</a> show that recessions are characterized by the joint occurence of soft economic data and tight financial conditions: the recession risk nowcast leverages this insight to produce timely and reliable estimates of the probability that the economy is undergoing a recession. </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-simple-item">
                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: What is the schedule for reporting and updating the recession risk estimates?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: The recession risk nowcast estimates the probability that the economy is in a state of recession in the current month. For example, a 25% recession risk for November means there is a 25% chance the economy is in a state of recession in November. These estimates are available on the first business day after the reference month closes. For example, recession risk for November becomes available on the first business day of December. This is possible because the model uses timely indicators: the ISM PMI Manufacturing (released at the beginning of the next month), the Economic Sentiment Indicator (released at month-end), and the CISS financial stress index (available daily).</div>

                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: What are the input data?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: The bayesian logit model combines macroeconomic and financial indicators specific to each region or country. For the US, it uses the ISM PMI Manufacturing and the Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS). The ISM PMI Manufacturing is a monthly survey of purchasing managers at manufacturing companies that measures business conditions and economic activity in the manufacturing sector. For each European region and country (Euro Area, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy), it uses their respective Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) paired with their respective CISS. The ESI captures real economic activity through comprehensive business and consumer surveys, while the CISS measures financial market stress across bonds, equities, money markets, foreign exchange, and financial intermediaries.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-simple-item">
                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: Why do you include financial conditions alongside economic indicators?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: Financial conditions provide crucial complementary information about the current state of the economy. <a href="https://doi.org/10.4337/9781035310050.00011" target="_blank">Furno and Giannone (2024)</a> show that financial stress often signals economic distress in real-time, sometimes before it shows up in traditional economic data. For instance, the model picked up high recession risk in late 2008 during the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which was later confirmed as part of the Great Recession. This is also consistent with the role played by financial conditions in Growth-at-Risk estimates, as shown by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161923" target="_blank">Adrian, Boyarchenko, and Giannone (2019)</a>.</div>

                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: How are recessions measured?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: Official recession dates are determined by national business cycle dating committees: the NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) for the US, CEPR (Centre for Economic Policy Research) for the Euro Area, the German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) for Germany, the French Business Cycle Dating Committee (AFSE) for France, and the Spanish Business Cycle Dating Committee (AEE) for Spain. Since Italy does not have a business cycle dating committee, the Euro Area CEPR dates are used. These committees identify periods of "significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months." These official recession periods are represented on our charts as shaded vertical bands.</div>

                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: What is the estimation sample?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: The recession risk estimates use data starting from different periods for each region/country: 1980:m1 for the US, 1985:m1 for the Euro Area and Germany, 1985:m2 for France, 1991:m7 for Spain, and 1986:m1 for Italy. All estimates run through the latest available month. The reported estimates are produced with a pseudo out-of-sample expanding window approach, to highlight the model's stability over time and its accuracy in real-time conditions. Importantly, a 24-month estimation delay is applied when estimating the model to account for the inherent uncertainty in classifying periods as recessions or expansions in real-time, since official recession announcements typically come with significant delays.</div>

                    <div class="faq-simple-item">
                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: How accurate are these estimates compared to other methods?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: The model demonstrates strong accuracy in identifying both recessions and expansions. When benchmarked against the Survey of Professional Forecasters for the US, the nowcast shows similar ability to identify economic downturns but is more accurate at correctly identifying periods of expansion - meaning it better identifies periods of expansion.</div>

                        <div class="faq-simple-question">Q: Are these estimates revised, and how reliable are they in real-time?</div>
                        <div class="faq-simple-answer">A: The estimates are subject to minimal revisions because the underlying data sources are timely and stable. The CISS uses financial market prices (which aren't revised), and the PMI/ESI surveys have only minor seasonal adjustments. Tests using real-time data vintages are available in <a href="https://doi.org/10.4337/9781035310050.00011" target="_blank">Furno and Giannone (2024)</a> and confirm high stability over time. The correlation between initial estimates and final estimates is 0.99 for the US and 0.98 for the Euro Area, confirming their reliability for real-time decision making.</div>
